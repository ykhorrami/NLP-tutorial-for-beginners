### Goal: Predicting the emotions of a sentence

We use the datasets from the "UCI Machine Learning Repository" by following address:
https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/331/sentiment+labelled+sentences

Score is either 1 (for positive) or 0 (for negative)	
The sentences come from three different websites/fields:

imdb.com
amazon.com
yelp.com

For each website, there exist 500 positive and 500 negative sentences. Those were selected randomly for larger datasets of reviews. 
We attempted to select sentences that have a clearly positive or negative connotaton, the goal was for no neutral sentences to be selected.



For the full datasets look:

imdb: Maas et. al., 2011 'Learning word vectors for sentiment analysis'
amazon: McAuley et. al., 2013 'Hidden factors and hidden topics: Understanding rating dimensions with review text'
